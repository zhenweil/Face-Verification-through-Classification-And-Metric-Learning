# Face-Verification-through-Classification-And-Metric-Learning
## Introduction
This project uses Resnet18 to perform face verification. Resnet18 learns to extract face embeddings during training, and cosine similarities between embeddings are calculated to measure face similarities.
## Dataset
The dataset contains images for 4000 different persons. Each person has 20-100 sample images.
## Training
