# Face-Verification-through-Classification-And-Metric-Learning
This model calculates similarities between two faces.
## Introduction
This project uses Resnet18 to perform face verification. During training, Resnet18 learns to extract face embeddings. Cosine similarities between face embeddings are calculated as the metric of face similarities.
